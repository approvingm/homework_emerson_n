 Question 1: Declaritive knowledge consists of facts and oter forms of truth where as imperative knowledge consists of instructions to conclude information.
The difference between the two is that decaritive knowledge is more statement oriented and can be proven while imperative knowledge is more algorithmic and is not just simply stating the truth.

Question 2: A fixed program computer is one designed for specific purposes and are mad to complete certain tasks. Stored-program computers are have a designed and managed flexability that is only limited by the limitations given by it. 
Therefore the difference between the two types is that the stored-program computers have the potential to be extremely versitile machines that can complete various types of tasks unlike fixed-program computers that are only made for specific tasks.

Question 3: This example of an uncomputable function is one program, P, that will run forever. An example of this type of unrunnable program would a program made to compute Pi.

Question 4: The significance of the notion of Turing Completeness in the context of this discussion is that it what matters is that all of them are
